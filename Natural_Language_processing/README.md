# Text Tokenization with NLTK

This Python project demonstrates how to use the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text tokenization. It includes examples of sentence and word tokenization, as well as detokenization (reconstructing text).

## Features

- **Sentence Tokenization**: Splitting text into sentences.
- **Word Tokenization**: Splitting sentences into words.
- **Word-Punctuation Tokenization**: Tokenizing text while keeping punctuation.
- **Detokenization**: Rebuilding text from tokenized words.

## Requirements

Install NLTK using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk
